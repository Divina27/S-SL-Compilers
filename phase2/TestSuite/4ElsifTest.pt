const a := 1
const b := 2

%well, given that all the statements need to be tested, I don't feel the need to have a test specifically for statement section itself
%this uses case b of the options to implement elsif, which should make it into a nested if statement
if a > b then
  put ("a > b (if)") putln
elsif a < b then
  put ("a < b (elsif)") putln
else
  put ("a = b (else)") putln
end if
