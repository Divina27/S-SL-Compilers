external output

var x : string
var y : integer

%this test handling of the new string type in minit and the operators that comes with it (substring and length)
x := "Hi there" @ 1 .. 2 %should give the output stream given on sheet
y := ? "length test" %length 11 string

%since I haven't look at how the handling is done, I don't know if an error test case for the old car data type is needed or not
