In scan.ssl, in input character classes
added lAtSign for '@', lQuestionMark for '?', lPercent for '%'
these are new input character classes in MiniT

In parser.pt, in the charClassMap section of Initialize procedure
add:

  charClassMap[ord('?')] := lQuestion;
  charClassMap[ord('%')] := lPercent;
'@','%', '?' are the new classes of characters in MiniT

In parser.pt, in the misc. section,
change from quote = ''''; to quote = '"';  
Reuse the existing lQuote character class to refer to the MiniT double quote " instead of single quote '

In scan.ssl, in the non-compund token of output tokens

added recognition to new syntax token pPlusEquals, pMinusEquals, pPlusPlus, pMinusMinus, pAtSign, pQuestionMark
update scanner to be able to emit the new syntax tokens in MiniT
